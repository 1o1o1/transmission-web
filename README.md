Transmission Web Interface (Clutch) is an Old-Style WebUI for the Transmission BitTorrent<br>
client. It allows you to manage your torrents from anywhere you can access the<br>
internet, and runs on OS X and various flavors of *nix. It provides most of<br>
the basic features of the desktop client, including torrent upload, torrent<br>
start/stop, file path selection, speed limiting etc.<br>

Transmission has been built from the ground up to be a lightweight, yet<br>
powerful BitTorrent client. Its simple, intuitive interface is designed<br>
to integrate tightly with whatever computing environment you choose to<br>
use. Transmission strikes a balance between providing useful functionality<br>
without feature bloat. Furthermore, it is free for anyone to use or modify.<br>

You will need to install either transmission-daemon, transmission-gtk2 or both to use WebUI.<br>

And Yes! This WebUI can work well with newer verions 4.0.x.<br>
